Telegraf is a plugin-driven server agent for collecting & reporting metrics.<br>
			Telegraf has plugins to source a variety of metrics
			directly from the system itâ€™s running on, pull metrics
			from third party APIs, or even listen for metrics via
			a statsd and Kafka consumer services. It also has output
			plugins to send metrics to a variety of other datastores,
			services, and message queues, including InfluxDB, Graphite,
			OpenTSDB, Datadog, Librato, Kafka, MQTT, NSQ, and many others.
